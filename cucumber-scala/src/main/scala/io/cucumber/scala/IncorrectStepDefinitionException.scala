      |This can happen if you are using a regular expression in your step definition with optional capture groups but mandatory parameters.
      |
      |For instance:
      |
      |  Given($tripleDoubleQuotes^I am logged in(?: as (.+))?$$$tripleDoubleQuotes) { (user: String) =>

      |  }

      |For now, the easiest solution is to declare two steps: one with the capture groups, one without.
