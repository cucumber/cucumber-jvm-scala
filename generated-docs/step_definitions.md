# Step definitions

Step definitions (`Given`, `When`, `Then`) are the glue between features written in Gherkin and the actual tests implementation.

Cucumber supports two types of expressions:

- Cucumber expressions
- Regular expressions

See also the [reference documentation](https://docs.cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/step-definitions/#expressions).

## Cucumber expressions

[Cucumber expressions](https://docs.cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/cucumber-expressions/)

The following Gherkin step:
```gherkin
Given I have 42 cucumbers in my belly
```

Can be implemented with following Cucumber Expression in Scala:
```scala
Given("""I have {int} cucumbers in my belly"""){ (cucumberCount: Int) =>
  // Do something    
}
```

## Regular expressions

The following Gherkin step:
```gherkin
Given I have 42 cucumbers in my belly
```

Can be implemented with following Regular Expression in Scala:
```scala
Given("""^I have (\d+) cucumbers in my belly$"""){ (cucumberCount: Int) =>
  // Do something    
}
```
